        An <b>enumerably infinite set</b> is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies <del>that</del> instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from a <i>arbitrary</i> "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as <em>y = m + n</em> - two arbitrary "input variables" <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> that produce an output <em>y</em>.
